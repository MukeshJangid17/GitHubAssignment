0,100. Bobby (1973),"Rich Hindu adolescent lad Raja (Kapoor) falls for Bobby (Kapadia), the 16-year-old granddaughter of his Goan Catholic nanny. When his snobbish parents object to their ‘friendship’, the young lovers decide to elope. This landmark film was a resounding success as Indian audiences had rarely ever seen teenage love expressed so sensuously on screen. The lead duo was believable too, and Kapadia became a national sensation with her mini-skirts and halter tops – an exposing bikini sequence was especially eye-grabbing. Laxmikant Pyarelal’s fresh soundtrack added to the appeal of this sweet film, with every song remaining a hit to this day."
1,99. Hum Aapke Hain Koun…! (1994),"This 1990s blockbuster was directly responsible for audiences in India and elsewhere returning to Bollywood after a drastic drop in attendance in the 1980s due to video piracy and disillusionment with the crude action films of that era. Expect 14 songs, two weddings and a cremation. Nothing else really happens, yet its shameless lavish depiction of every celebration of a perfect north Indian family, and especially their elaborate colourful Hindu wedding rituals, sucked audiences into cinemas again and again. ‘HAHK’, as it is known, is the film which kickstarted the global awareness of modern Bollywood."
2,98. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013),"This romantic comedy fits the Bollywood template perfectly: it boasts flamboyant colours, songs and dance and, more importantly, a big fat Indian wedding. It tells of two characters, Bunny (Kapoor) and Naina (Padukone), and their group of friends, who we first meet as they leave university before the film flashes forward to the end of their twenties. What made the film doubly successful was that its two stars were former lovers in real life, lending them a special chemistry onscreen."
3,97. Veer-Zaara (2004),"Yash Chopra, Bollywood’s most successful and respected director, delivers a groundbreaking musical romance on an epic scale. Will the love that Indian Hindu Veer (Khan) and Pakistani Muslim Zaara (Zinta) feel for each other be able to overcome cross-cultural, emotional and physical borders? Chopra employs his trademark ‘chiffon sari in the Swiss Alps’ style while including progressive political and social messages about Indo-Pak unity, women’s rights, inept justice and hope for the future. The late composer Madan Mohan and Lata Mangeshkar’s tunes achieve lyrical perfection. The result is an uplifting, colourful and soulful gem."
4,96. Umrao Jaan (1981),"This is an adaptation of Mirza Hadi Ruswa’s well-known 1899 novel about a Lucknow courtesan called Umrao Jaan (Rekha) who fights to escape the profession she was kidnapped into by following the path of true love. The carefully crafted period setting captivated viewers and critics on its release, and the story was told again in 2006, this time with Aishwarya Rai in the title role."
5,95. Swades (2004),"In Swades, director Ashutosh Gowariker turned his gaze from pre-Independence India (his previous film was the Oscar-nominated Lagaan) to the present day and served up a movie that took a loving but unflinchingly critical look at ‘our country’ (as the title translates). Shah Rukh Khan plays US resident Mohan, who makes a life-altering trip to an Indian village that’s short of electricity and riven with petty conflicts. As many of us who live in countries other than those of our birth do, he slowly comes to realise the truth of the adage spoken by one of the villagers: ‘It is the destiny of ice to melt in its own water.’"
6,94. Salaam Bombay! (1998),"This story of kids living on the streets of Bombay isn’t Bollywood in the traditional sense. Writer-director Mira Nair had lived and studied in the US for several years by the time she returned to India to make her eye-opening drama about a young boy, Krishna (Syed) falling deeper and deeper into trouble in the big city. But this is still one of the most stark, realistic films to emerge from India in recent times. Nair cast real street children, something that Danny Boyle would later do for ‘Slumdog Millionaire’, and the film’s strength is that it observes and illuminates but does not judge – we’re given more than enough room to make up our own minds on the issues raised by the film."
7,93. Gully Boy (2019),"Like Danny Boyle’s Slumdog Millionaire, this film is set in the vibrant Dharavi slums of Mumbai. Key protagonist Murad Ahmed, played to perfection by Ranveer Singh, goes on an Eminem, 8 Mile-style journey, honing his craft with Shrikant ‘MC Sher’ Bhosle (Siddhant Chaturvedi) and Shweta ‘Sky’ Mehta (Kalki Koechlin) as supporters, while tending to his overprotective, doctor-to-be girlfriend, Safeena Firdausi (Alia Bhatt). Performing in a concert to impress rapper Nas becomes Murad’s goal. We follow the twists and turns of how his aims to turn his musical dreams into a reality, battling more than just words, but people, staid office jobs and social conventions that stand in his way."
8,92. Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006),"Three years after making his debut with the sleeper hit, ‘Munna Bhai MBBS’, director Rajkumar Hirani brought back the lovable gangster Munna Bhai (Dutt) – for the best sequel ever made by Bollywood. Munna starts brushing up on his knowledge about Gandhi in order to impress a radio host. Soon, Gandhi materialises before Munna and starts having conversations with him, leading everyone to believe he’s lost his mind. Theatre actor Dilip Prabhavalkar made a rare Hindi film appearance as Gandhi, and nailed a character that’s always been tough to portray on screen."
9,91. Ardh Satya (1983),"Here, Govind Nihalani’s trademark ‘law and order’ political cinema exposes police brutality in the Bombay force. Anant (Puri) is a no-nonsense cop who is thwarted at every level by the system in his effort to arrest a crooked politician. When he kills a small-time thief, he is forced to seek protection from the same politician he loathes. A surprise hit as it had no major stars or hit songs, ‘Ardh Satya’ remains a realistic, caustic comment on the worrying nexus between corrupt politicians and bent cops in India then and now. Om Puri’s explosive performance is enthralling."
10,90. Hera Pheri (2000),"In this popular comedy, a nonsensical plot about a botched kidnapping and phone calls going to the wrong number is balanced by some fine acting from lead actors Kumar, Shetty and Rawal. The latter became an overnight star on the back of ‘Hera Pheri’ after being on the sidelines as a supporting actor for many years. His portrayal of an alcoholic, naïve, half-blind garage owner, who rents his home out to two young boys, brought the house down. The film remains enjoyable even after repeat viewings."
11,89. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013),"Milkha Singh – known as The Flying Sikh – was a world-champion Olympic runner in the 1950s and 1960s, who infamously lost the most important race of his life. ‘Bhaag Milkha Bhaag’ shows us how he came to be one of India’s greatest runners, and how he overcame the demons of witnessing the massacre of his family during India’s partition. The success of the film comes from its strong attention to detail, a superb performance from Farhan Akhtar as Singh and an inspiring story."
12,88. Dhobi Ghat (2011),"Kiran Rao broke into filmmaking with this film about five characters, the fifth being the city of Mumbai (the title translates as ‘Mumbai Diaries’). Arun (Khan) is a reclusive painter who moves into a new apartment and finds video diaries left by the previous tenant, Yasmin (Kriti Malhotra). Shai (Dogra) is a photographer who befriends Munna (Babbar), a slum boy who hopes to break into Bollywood. Tushar Kanti Ray’s cinematography and Gustavo Santaolalla’s background score both beautifully complement this story about different classes of people co-existing in Mumbai."
13,87. Kati Patang (1970),"Inspired by the Hollywood weepie ‘No Man of Her Own’ (1950), Shakti Samanta’s film addresses the still-taboo theme of widows remarrying. The film goes out of its way to proclaim the untainted virgin status of its female lead, as Madhu (Parekh) only pretends to be a widow in order to assume a new identity. Complications follow when she is attracted to her ‘dead’ husband’s best mate (Khanna). The real superstar of this melodramatic film is RD Burman’s classic score: every track remains popular to this day."
14,86. Black Friday (2004),"Long before director Anurag Kashyap broke on to the international scene with films like 2012’s ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’, he struggled to release this controversial real-life drama about the infamous 1993 bomb blasts in Mumbai – arguably his best film to date. Kashyap stuck to investigative journalist Hussain Zaidi’s version of the planning, execution and aftermath of the explosions and extracted great performances from his ensemble cast. ‘Black Friday’ is a rare thing: an engaging Hindi film based on a true story."
15,85. Gangs of Wasseypur: Part One (2012),"Anurag Kashyap is Hindi cinema’s Quentin Tarantino, and this is his ‘Reservoir Dogs’, a bloody, brutal and visually arresting gangster film which centres on feuding families and a coal-mining racket. Menacing mafia don Sardar Khan (Bajpai), and his Bollywood-loving, stoner son Faizal (Siddiqui), are both compelling screen presences. Kashyap rips to shreds Bollywood’s tradition of shooting airbrushed heroes and heroines in pristine locations. Instead this oozes blood and black humour. Kashyap made ‘Part Two’ at the same time."
16,84. Arth (1982),"This is truly mature cinema. Mahesh Bhatt’s breakout film ‘Arth’ was partly autobiographical, giving it a sense of intimacy still rare in Hindi cinema. Pooja (Azmi) finds the bubble of her happy marriage starting to burst when she discovers that her filmmaker husband, Inder (Kharbanda), is having an affair with Kavita (Patil). Pooja’s search for her own identity leads her to many revelations, while Inder is ultimately left alone."
17,83. Dhoom (2004),"Bollywood’s most successful modern franchise features stylish villains on the run from a lovable yet inept duo: policeman Dixit (Bachchan) and Ali (Chopra), a thief whose help he seeks out. So far there have been three ‘Dhoom’ movies, and in this first one the villain was Kabir (Abraham), the head of a motorbike gang. The series is heavily defined by its stunt action set pieces and owes a big debt to the likes of ‘The Fast and the Furious’ and ‘Ocean’s Eleven’."
18,82. Kahaani (2012),"A heavily pregnant woman (Vidya Balan) arrives in Kolkata alone and goes straight to the police station. But why? So begins a shadowy quest to track down her missing husband and a gauntlet of police officers inclined to dismiss the worries of a pregnant woman. Slowly, director Sujoy Ghosh draws them – and us – into her web of secrets and lies, as the mission begins to morph into something more sinister. Ghosh expertly sows the culture of Kolkata deep into his thriller, so much so that the city becomes a character in the story and a much-needed ally for Vidya."
19,81. Dabangg (2010),"Writer-director Abhinav Kashyap paid tribute to 1970s Hindi cinema with this entertaining action movie that gave actor Salman Khan’s stardom a boost, and revived the masala genre in a major way (not entirely a good thing). Khan plays the iconic Chulbul Pandey, a corrupt cop in north India who goes after politicians and gangsters and refers to himself as ‘Robin Hood’ Pandey. There are several plot holes, but the film rides on a breezy script, Khan’s charm and some well-choreographed action scenes."
20,80. Black (2005),"This drama about a deaf-mute woman, Michelle (Mukerji), and her struggle through education was loosely inspired by the true story of Helen Keller. Like most films directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali (‘Guzaarish’), ‘Black’ is at times uncomfortably manipulative and awkward in its attempt to inspire. But there’s no denying that Bhansali conjures up gorgeous worlds. Strong heroines and stories of female ambition are still fairly rare in Hindi movies, and it’s impossible not to cheer for the determined Michelle as she stumbles in the shadows."
21,79. Thappad (2020),"‘Just a slap – but he can’t hit me,’ says a tremblingly defiant Amrita (Taapsee Pannu) in Thappad. A perfect housewife and daughter-in-law, she has found no reason to complain until in a sudden and uncharacteristic moment of stress her husband Vikram (Gulati) slaps her. It’s the first time he’s done this, but this one act opens Amrita’s eyes to the many tiny injustices of the life she’s been living. She asks for a divorce, and sticks by her decision even when she learns she is pregnant. This feminist drama tells Amrita’s story, but surrounds it with stories of the women around her – her mother, her mother-in-law, her neighbour, her lawyer, her neighbour’s daughter, her brother’s girlfriend – and their relationships with the men in their lives. Pannu’s stirring performance anchors it all.The big scene: Vikram asks their neighbour, a witness to the slap, to lie to the authorities and testify that he didn’t assault his wife. A widow, she fixes him with a beady look and mentions her beloved late husband. ‘I would like to believe men are wonderful people,’ she says, ‘so I will pretend I did not hear what you just said.’"
22,78. Bandit Queen (1994),"The novelist Arundhati Roy criticised Shekhar Kapur’s version of the life of Phoolan Devi (Biswas) for simplifying the criminal-turned-politician’s experiences to fit a typical rape-revenge story. Devi was a bandit who was jailed for acts of revenge against people who abused her as a child and who later became a politician. But ‘Bandit Queen’ remains a harrowing depiction of fearful and unforgiving lives in rural Uttar Pradesh. The film succeeds in making us all witnesses to its horrors – and complicit in them when, like so many of the characters, we say nothing."
23,77. Kabhie Kabhie (1976),"Yash Chopra’s most romantic movie is a superior Bollywood soap dealing with intergenerational love, personal sacrifices and secrets and lies in the lives of two middle-class Delhi families. College sweethearts Amit (Bachchan) and Pooja (Gulzar) separate when Pooja announces that her parents have arranged her marriage to Vijay (Kapoor). Years later, the respective adults and their teenage kids meet… The film’s strong social messages – that the past is the past and that the younger generation will marry the partners of their choice – hold true today."
24,76. Udaan (2010),"After spending eight years at a boarding school, 16-year-old Rohan (Barmecha) is expelled and returns home to Jamshedpur to discover that his father has remarried and been widowed a second time in his absence. Rohan also has a young stepbrother he knew nothing about. He dreams of becoming a writer, but instead he’s forced to work in the family business and later to attend engineering school. ‘Udaan’ offers a realistic set-up, a simple story familiar to many Indians and some superb, understated performances. This isn’t the classic idea of Bollywood, but it’s a strong film nevertheless."
25,75. Zubeidaa (2001),"The voice of Bollywood’s nightingale Lata Mangeshkar and the music of composer AR Rahman sweep through this poignant period tale about Zubeida, the beautiful mistress to a king. Karisma Kapoor plays the doe-eyed princess to perfection, and Khalid Mohamed, son of actress Zubeida Begum, wrote the script, based on the tragic life story of his own mother."
26,74. Teesri Kasam (1966),"Bullock-cart driver Hiraman (Kapoor) takes a mysterious female passenger, Hirabai (Rehman), to a faraway fair. En route, they bond over some meaningful songs and food. She reveals that she is a dancer. They arrive at their destination and the villagers speculate that Hirabai may actually be a whore. Hiraman appears oblivious; he is smitten. Pure star power, frequent songs, and scenic black-and-white cinematography of rural Bihar (the monochrome was a deliberate choice, as India’s first colour film was in 1964) combine to sustain interest in this progressive culture-class-clash love story."
27,73. Naseeb (1981),"Manmohan Desai’s star-filled film repeats his customary ‘lost and found’ formula of villains separating a young family who in adulthood reunite to seek revenge. Desai’s frequent use of two-second shots and close-ups whips the proceedings along. Like his earlier classic ‘Amar Akbar Anthony’ (1977), this is Bollywood kitsch at its best."
28,72. Zanjeer (1973),"The action-packed ‘Zanjeer’ was an early masterpiece from the writing duo Salim-Javed, giving Amitabh Bachchan his first major role and cementing his ‘Angry Young Man’ status. It’s an unapologetically bitter and stylish revenge story about an honest cop, Vijay (Bachchan), who has been haunted since childhood by nightmares about his father’s murder by a stranger – but all that’s known about the killer is that he wore a bracelet with a white stallion charm. As an adult, Vijay’s path crosses the gangster responsible, Teja (Ajit), and the stage is set for a final showdown."
29,71. Omkara (2006),"Vishal Bhardwaj’s modern ‘Othello’, set in northern India’s Uttar Pradesh, sidesteps Bollywood bombast and keeps its emotions in check. Bhardwaj extracts surprising performances from actors previously associated with more populist work: his cast display real torment and depth, particularly Saif Ali Khan as a deformed, scheming ‘Iago’ (called Langda here). ‘Omkara’ is one of Bhardwaj’s three adaptations of Shakespeare for Hindi cinema: 2003’s ‘Maqbool’ interpreted ‘Macbeth’, while 2014’s ‘Haider’ did the same for ‘Hamlet’."
30,70. Chhoti Si Baat (1975),"An expert at depicting the urban middle class, director Basu Chatterjee’s protagonist in ‘Chhoti Si Baat’ is once again a simple man (played expertly by Palekar) faced with simple problems and finding simple solutions to deal with them. Arun is an unconfident man who fantasises about wooing Prabha (Sinha). He is taken under the wing of a fun-loving colonel (Kumar), who helps young men overcome their shortcomings. An adaptation of ‘School for Scoundrels’, the film is best remembered for its portrayal of 1970s Bombay and its quirky humour."
31,69. Jewel Thief (1967),"This spy thriller tells of Vinay (Anand), an ordinary young man with a striking resemblance to a jewel thief, Amar (also Anand). It’s three hours of decadence, with loose gems, fast women and a hero on the run. Its staying power comes not just from its extraordinary visual indulgences – the film is candy-coloured, classy and sexy – but also from a brilliant script that carefully reveals layer after layer and eventually turns one of Hindi cinema’s favourite tropes on its head. Almost 50 years later, watching the details unfold is still a breathtaking experience."
32,68. Devdas (2002),"Extravagant yet still full of heart: Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s opulent adaptation of Sarat Chandra’s simplistic novel marked a move into excessive theatricality for the director, whose films since include ‘Guzaarish’ and ‘Saawariya’. His style was at its most organic and daring in ‘Devdas’. Its main characters, Devdas (Khan) and Paro (Rai), are childhood lovers, but class differences and difficult parents cause them to separate. Full of spite, Devdas goes on a drinking binge and ends up in the arms of a dancing girl, Chandramukhi (Dixit). Chandramukhi falls in love with a broken Devdas, but he can’t think of anything beyond Paro, alcohol and death."
33,67. Gunga Jumna (1961),"This 1961 drama helped to set the template for what would become a Bollywood staple: stories of brothers on opposite sides of the law. Poverty-stricken villager Gunga (Kumar) scrapes together just enough money to fund an education for his younger brother Jumna (Khan). Jumna becomes a police officer, while Gunga joins a group of bandits after heroically defending his love against a powerful landowner. The brothers head towards an unavoidable face-off."
34,66. Madhumati (1958),"Director Bimal Roy’s rare foray into commercial cinema was a heady cocktail of revenge, romance and reincarnation, with a supernatural element thrown in. City-bred Anand (Kumar) moves to a village to manage the estate of the evil Ugaranarayan (the legendary Pran), who rapes and murders Anand’s lover, Madhumati (Vyjayantimala). A grief-stricken Anand finds a lookalike of Madhumati and talks her into luring Ugaranayaran to confess his crime. The film boasts a brilliant score by Salil Choudhury."
35,65. Chandni (1989),"It’s the ultimate love triangle: Rohit (Kapoor) and Chandni (Sridevi) meet at a wedding and fall in love. But just before they get married, an accident takes away Rohit’s legs and self-esteem, forcing Chandni to exit the relationship. She meets Lalit (Khanna), who himself is nursing a broken heart, and things get complicated. Director Yash Chopra’s clever handling of the story, which offers a distinctly female perspective on troubled love, makes ‘Chandni’ rise way above the pack."
36,64. Jagte Raho (1956),"This experimental film by directing duo Amit Maitra and Sombhu Mitra sees Raj Kapoor playing a thirsty villager stuck in a city apartment block after being mistaken for a thief. Kapoor’s unnamed character moves from one part of the building to another, coming across several people, all of whom hide murky secrets. This largely single-character-driven film features several cameo appearances by well-known Hindi film actors, each playing various urban folk who Kapoor is first scared of, and later comes to despise."
37,63. Secret Superstar (2017),"The highest grossing Indian film to boast a female lead, ‘Secret Superstar’ is more than just another Bollywood musical. The film follows the journey of Insia (Wasim), a teenager who dreams of escaping her abusive father and becoming a singer. After a video of herself singing a song while wearing a niqab to protect her identity goes viral, she has to either face her father’s wrath or give up her dream. At its heart, though, this is a film about the relationship between mother and daughter that explores women’s positions in India’s traditional, male-dominated society.  "
38,62. Sharmeelee (1971),"‘Sharmeelee’ is a typical example of that Bollywood storytelling staple: good twin versus bad twin. Ajit (Kapoor) marries the shy Kanchan (Raakhee), thinking she is the vivacious Kamini (also Raakhee), not realising they are identical twins. Kamini spots the couple at a nightclub and decides she can have the domestic bliss she craves by eradicating her meek sister and taking her place. The outlandish plot is played straight as it clumsily examines the nature of surface beauty and inner goodness. The film’s main selling point today is SD Burman’s soundtrack, especially the undervalued Lata Mangeshkar solo ‘Megha Chhaye Aadhi Raat’ (‘Dark clouds have covered the skies’)."
39,61. Parineeta (1953),"Understated elegance is the order of the day in this adaptation of a Bengali novel. As brought to life by director Bimal Roy, it’s a nuanced tale of true love lost and found, with astute performances from celebrated actors Ashok Kumar and Meena Kumari. The 2005 remake was similarly well received, and made Vidya Balan an overnight star in India."
40,60. Lootera (2013),"Vikramaditya Motwane re-imagined O Henry’s short story ‘The Last Leaf’ for this film about a simple girl, Pakhi (Sinha), who falls in love with a robber, Varun (Singh), when he arrives in her town pretending to be an archaeologist. Effectively recreating the 1950s era, complete with Dev Anand film songs playing on the radio, ‘Lootera’ brought together an ace technical team made up of production designer Aditya Kanwar and cinematographer Mahendra Shetty, who gave the film a distinct, lush period look."
41,59. Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke (1993),"In this remake of Cary Grant’s ‘Houseboat’ (1958), Vyjayanti (Chawla), the bubbly daughter of a conservative Tamil family, escapes from an upcoming forced marriage and finds kindred spirits in three children who decide to hide her at their home, under the nose of their guardian Rahul (Khan). When Rahul discovers her, she becomes the children’s governess and what follows is a story of love between opposites. A wonderfully sweet soundtrack accompanies this delightful, light and entertaining family comedy."
42,58. Garam Hawa (1973),"Also known as ‘Scorching Winds’, this is perhaps the most important and accurate Indian film to depict the plight of minority Muslims in northern India following Partition in 1947. Set in the late 1940s, Salim (Sahni), an elderly Muslim shoemaker must decide whether or not to leave his ancestral home in Agra and migrate across the border to newly-created Pakistan. Meanwhile, Hindu-Muslim tensions at home threaten to rip apart his family. Director MS Sathyu, a Marxist activist, created a heart-wrenching tale of innocent lives torn apart by hatred and suspicion. Balraj Sahni’s noble performance will move you to tears, and the issues are equally relevant to India today."
43,57. Mr & Mrs ’55 (1955),"Director Guru Dutt uses a familiar plot to hilarious effect in this satire of India’s urban upper class in the post-independence period. Anita (Madhubala) can only inherit her father’s wealth if she gets married – leading her feminist aunt to suggest that she goes through a ‘fake’ marriage with cartoonist Preetam (Dutt) and then ‘divorce’ as soon as possible afterwards. But, of course, both Anita and Preetam fall in love… Dutt’s unique directing style is put to inventive use during the songs: the camera appears never to sit still. The film is best remembered today for the tunes sung by Geeta Dutt (the director’s wife) and for being truly funny. It’s an irresistible and impeccably cast film."
44,56. Aiyyaa (2012),"Filmmaker Sachin Kundalkar took one of three parallel stories he previously told in the 2009 Marathi-language film ‘Gandha’ and turned it into a madcap Hindi comedy with fantasy elements. Meenakshi (Mukerji) falls in love with Tamil boy Surya (Prithviraj) after she’s drawn to his smell. The bizarre characters around Meenakshi include her father, who smokes four cigarettes at once; a grandmother with gold teeth; and her friend Mynah (a superb Date), who has a weird Lady Gaga obsession."
45,55. Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978),"Raj Kapoor’s attempt to portray the conflict between the sacred and the profane, and to show that beauty is only skin deep, is an admittedly patchy affair. When engineer Ranjeev (Shashi Kapoor) hears the religious songs sung by ‘ugly’ village belle Rupa (Aman), he is convinced her face will be as beautiful as her voice. He marries her without seeing her, so the shallow groom is understandably upset on his wedding night. It’s a flawed masterpiece that is guilty of exactly of what it purports to criticise. But it’s also groundbreaking for its sexual explicitness, including wet kisses. Excellent soundtrack, too."
46,"54. Baahubali: The Beginning & Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2015, 2017)","These blockbusters play like the Bollywood ‘Black Panther’. Inspired by Indian mythology and the Amar Chitra Katha comic-book series, director SS Rajamouli’s two-part fantasy epic about a young man, Shivudu, who later discovers his name is Mahendra Baahubali (don’t ask, it’s complicated), offers some of the most spectacular Indian cinema ever made. Both films blend high fantasy and action with an almost Shakespearean sense of drama, resulting in a double bill that knows when to rein it in. Just. Like the ‘Wakanda forever!’ salute in ‘Black Panther’, ‘Baahubali’ will always be associated with the chant ‘Jai Mahishmathi’. "
47,53. Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam (1962),"‘Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam’ is a period film about the end of an era. Abrar Alvi’s adaptation of a Bengali novel by Bimal Mitra is about the stormy relationship between a rich, decadent business owner (Rehman), his lovelorn wife (Meena Kumari) and their young servant (Guru Dutt). It’s all told against the backdrop of the last days of the old system of zamindari (a way of collecting tax) in colonial, nineteenth-century Bengal. Shot with great sensitivity and innovation by Guru Dutt’s main man VK Murthy, ‘Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam’ is a more romantic twin to Satyajit Ray’s ‘Jalsaghar’."
48,52. Tezaab (1988),"Actor Anil Kapoor followed his 1987 super-hit ‘Mr India’ with this film (the title means ‘Acid’) that gave actress Madhuri Dixit her breakout role, swept the box office and won four Filmfare awards (Bollywood’s equivalent to the Oscars). It tells of a criminal, Munna (Kapoor), trying to get himself back on the right side of the law while also attempting to rescue his love, Mohini (Dixit), from the grasp of her villainous father. It’s passionate and violent."
49,51. Sangam (1964),"This is cinema as love song. Two best friends from childhood, Sunder (Kapoor) and Gopal (Kumar) love the same girl, Radha (Vyjayanthimala). She marries Sunder, the one she doesn’t love, but then he goes missing at war. When Sunder returns, the discovery of an old love letter sows seeds of suspicion and friendships are tested. The standard love-triangle template is made exotic by Shankar-Jaikishan’s timeless music and Raj Kapoor’s love for foreign locales."
50,50. Rockstar (2011),"Ranbir Kapoor embodied the film’s tortured, Jim Morrison-like protagonist Jordan so convincingly that he had to keep reminding people that he wasn’t a real rock star. Jordan is one of Indian cinema’s most complex male characters. This, as well as glimpses of hidden India – like Nizamuddin Dargah, the mausoleum of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya, in Delhi – and the last appearance of Bollywood legend Shammi Kapoor (‘Junglee’) make ‘Rockstar’ a noteworthy addition to the rock biopic pantheon."
51,49. Main Hoon Na (2004),"Military man Ram (Khan) goes undercover as a university student in the name of peace between India and Pakistan. While stalking the villain, Ram also loses his heart to a chemistry professor. ‘Main Hoon Na’ exists in a knowingly meta world where global superstar Shah Rukh Khan involuntarily bursts into song every time Miss Universe (Sen) glides by. The film dances that fine line between parody and celebration like no mainstream Hindi film before or since. It’s a celebration of all things filmi – family reunions, the redemptive power of love, fantasies played out in song – while also reveling in how ridiculous it can all be."
52,48. Queen (2014),"A fiercely original filmmaking style and a novel plot made ‘Queen’ stand apart from all other 2014 releases, helping it to emerge as a critical and box-office hit. In a career-altering performance, Kangana Ranaut plays Rani, a sheltered small-town girl who decides to go on her honeymoon to Europe alone after she’s jilted at the altar. Writer-director Vikas Bahl displays a strong flair for capturing human behaviour and peppers a simple story with lovable characters and witty lines."
53,47. Mera Naam Joker (1970),"Director-star Raj Kapoor’s semi-autobiographical magnum opus is four hours of self-loathing angst, which crashed at the box office and almost bankrupted the director-actor. A sad clown, Raju (Kapoor), invites the women he loved and lost in his life to his last ever performance. Told in three ‘chapters’, this overlong film is awash with iffy symbolism about the meaning of life, exhibits a questionable attitude towards women and is burdened with a mother-fixation subplot. But for all its flaws, this is no-holds-barred epic filmmaking with a moving soundtrack."
54,46. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998),"Director Karan Johar began his association with Shah Rukh Khan with this romantic drama partly inspired by the Archie-Veronica-Betty trio in the American Archie comics. Rahul (Khan) and Anjali (Kajol) are best friends studying in the same college, but the tomboyish Anjali is threatened by the arrival of Tina (Mukerji). Years later, widower Rahul reconnects with Anjali. The film was a runaway hit, best remembered for Khan and Kajol’s sizzling chemistry and Jatin-Lalit’s music."
55,45. Velu Nayakan (1999),"‘Nayakan’, the original, 1987 Tamil version of this film, was dubbed into Hindi in 1999 to become ‘Velu Nayakan’. An epic crime movie, it’s loosely based on the life of Varadarajan Mudaliar (here becoming Velu Nayakan, played by Haasan), a real mafia slumlord in Bombay, and also explores the struggle of south Indians living in the city. It drew inspiration from Francis Ford Coppola’s ‘The Godfather’. The song ‘Thenpandi cheemaiyile’ tops a much-admired soundtrack by veteran Indian film composer Ilaiyaraaja, who has now scored over 1000 films in his career."
56,44. Enthiran: The Robot (2010),empty
57,43. Maine Pyar Kiya (1989),"Prem (Khan), a boy from a wealthy family, pursues forbidden love with working-class girl Suman (Bhagyashree). So far, so Bollywood, but ‘Maine Pyar Kiya’ managed simultaneously to kickstart megastar Salman Khan’s career, cement director Sooraj Barjatya’s box-office clout and redefine romance and friendship in Bollywood in a way that wasn’t bettered for years. Released in a decade signified by violent masala flicks, this family-friendly film with an evergreen soundtrack and iconic dialogue was immediately and widely admired."
58,42. Khakee (2004),"Amitabh Bachchan broke on to the scene with the role of angst-ridden cop Vijay in ‘Zanjeer’ (1973). ‘Khakee’ explores what would have happened to the character 30 years later. Vijay is an honest policeman who gets entangled in an operation that involves transferring a terrorist from a small village to the city. But as the ageing officer and his team go about their mission, they realise there are influential people who want the terrorist dead – so their lives are in danger too."
59,41. The Lunchbox (2013),"Ritesh Batra’s debut film turned out to be India’s most popular export in recent times, with rave reviews at Cannes followed by a wide release in the US, where the film ended up among the highest-grossing foreign-language films of the year. Simply structured yet purposeful, ‘The Lunchbox’ focuses on the lives of two lonely individuals, Saajan (Khan) and Ila (Kaur). Both jostle for some peace and happiness amid the buzz and mayhem of Mumbai, as they share notes through a tiffin box delivered back and forth."
60,40. Dil Se.. (1998),"‘Dil Se..’ was acclaimed south Indian filmmaker Mani Ratnam’s big plunge into Bollywood, achieved by teaming up with superstar Shah Rukh Khan. A box-office failure at the time, this story of a Delhi journalist falling in love with a terrorist has gained popularity in the years since. Ratnam’s interest in political issues may have clashed with Khan’s lover-boy image at the time, but at least the actor has one solid drama in his otherwise monotonous filmography."
61,39. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham… (2001),"‘It’s all about loving your parents,’ screamed the trailer for ‘Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham…’, a film that piled on the mush in true Karan Johar (‘My Name is Khan’) style. Here, Johar brought together a dream cast to play a fractured family. Billionaire Yashvardhan (Bachchan) is an authoritarian who banishes his adopted son Rahul (Khan) for marrying a woman against his wishes. Years later, Raj’s brother Rohan (Roshan) strives to bring the family together. Boasting opulent production design, lavish musical set pieces and an orgy of superstars, ‘K3G’ (as the film came to be known) is guilty-pleasure Bollywood at its best."
62,38. Jodhaa Akbar (2008),"This story of real-life Mughal emperor Akbar (Roshan) and his Hindu wife Jodhaa (Bachchan) doesn’t exactly follow the facts. But when artistic license is exercised so beautifully, who cares? Ashutosh Gowariker, director of the Oscar-nominated ‘Lagaan’, executes a perfect balance of spectacle, performances, ideas and story, never sacrificing the entertainment factor and allowing us to bask in the costumes and production design. He drenches his always-timely message of respect for all faiths in immeasurable imperial pomp."
63,37. Ghajini (2008),"Bearing many similarities to Christopher Nolan’s ‘Memento’, this way-over-the-top thriller leans heavily on its main character’s short-term-memory loss. Sanjay (Aamir Khan) is a leading Indian businessman, while Kalpana (Asin), a model, brags to everyone that she is Sanjay’s girl even though they’ve never met. When Sanjay discovers this, he decides to confront her but soon falls in love. However, Kalpana falls foul of a local crime lord and Sanjay is determined to avenge her death… ‘Ghajini’ was an enormous hit in India."
64,36. Kaala Patthar (1979),"The common man’s exploitation by greedy industrialists is the theme of ‘Kaala Patthar’, which loosely references the 1975 Chasnala disaster in which 375 miners drowned. Amitabh Bachchan plays sullen loner Vijay, a disgraced naval officer who abandoned a sinking ship; Shashi Kapoor is clean-cut engineer Ravi; and Shatrugan Sinha is escaped convict Mangal. Despite Ravi’s protests, the mine owner sacrifices safety for profit, but when the mine is flooded the trio unites. ‘Kaala Patthar’ wears its proletarian heart on its sleeve."
65,35. Chak De! India (2007),"Between clever gangster movie ‘Ab Tak Chhappan’ (2004) and the grossly underrated ‘Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year’ (2009), director Shimit Amin teamed up with writer Jaideep Sahni to give us this quintessential sports drama. The film narrates the story of a tainted ex-India hockey player (Khan) who coaches the women’s team to World Cup glory. While sticking to the underdog-overcomes-obstacles template, Amin and Sahni deftly weave in themes of cultural diversity, religious difference and feminism."
66,34. Ek Tha Tiger (2012),"Salman Khan adds a dash of cosmopolitan sophistication to his special brand of machismo with this story involving espionage and a love affair with an enemy agent (Kaif). As Tiger, Khan adheres to the muscle-man template, but he also struggles over questions of loyalty to his lady or his country – a complexity not always afforded to India’s defenders. This same dilemma is mirrored in Tiger’s colleague, Gopi (Shorey), who may have to rat out his friend."
67,33. Ankur (1974),"‘Ankur’ is the film that kickstarted an ‘arty-indie’ parallel film movement in Hindi cinema in the 1970s and early ’80s. Shyam Benegal’s directorial debut introduces Shabana Azmi (‘India’s Meryl Streep’) as Laxmi, the servant-wife of a deaf and dumb untouchable potter. Laxmi falls pregnant by bored middle-class student Surya (Nag) at his family’s holiday farmhouse. The rest of this admirable and realistic film explores the fallout from these events and bravely adopts a strong feminist stance. Gritty and political, this is an elegiac and essential rural melodrama."
68,32. Gol Maal (1979),"Where it all started. At least two generations of Indians will count this as the best homegrown comedy ever made, and with good reason. Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s immensely well-crafted comedy of double identities has Ramprasad (Amol Palekar) doubling up as his non-existent twin brother and wearing a fake moustache, just to convince his new boss Bhavani (Utpal Dutt) that it wasn’t him at a sports match. Throw in a couple of fake mums, the boss’s daughter who is in love with the other ‘brother’, a drunk Keshto Mukherjee and screenwriter Rahi Masoom Raza’s memorable lines, and this is a comedy for all seasons."
69,31. Barfi! (2012),"A success driven by word of mouth, ‘Barfi!’ observes the magical relationship between an autistic woman, Jhilmil (Chopra), and a deaf-mute guy, Barfi (Kapoor). The film has the air of a fairytale, and Kapoor’s twinkly-eyed, vividly expressive performance as the title character evokes Charlie Chaplin as well as his own grandfather, Raj Kapoor. ‘Barfi!’ announced Kapoor as a credible actor and rising superstar rather than just a pretty boy. He is the fourth generation of the Kapoor family to star in Hindi movies."
70,30. Prem Rog (1982),"Raj Kapoor tackles the controversial subject of widows remarrying with this stark critique of old-fashioned family and tenancy structures, all framed within a big, commercial movie. It’s held together by teenage actress Padmini Kolhapure, who is utterly convincing and sympathetic as the unlucky bride who discovers the true meaning of love. There are rough edges to ‘Prem Rog’ and some hammy acting, but ultimately its liberal and progressive stance wins you over."
71,29. Anand (1971),"Reigning superstar Rajesh Khanna plays the title character, whose days are numbered after he’s diagnosed with cancer. The film explores his relationship with his doctor, Bhaskar, played by a young Amitabh Bachchan (who would famously oust Khanna from the box-office top spot a few years later). Anand’s positive outlook on life and his playful demeanour is a lesson for those around him, even as Bhaskar, a more serious man, struggles with his inability to reverse Anand’s medical condition. Apart from the performances, the film is memorable for Salil Chowdhury’s score."
72,28. Silsila (1981),"Yash Chopra’s most infamous film is based on the alleged real-life affair between Bollywood’s biggest star, Amitabh Bachchan, and the ultimate diva, actress Rekha. Outrageously, Bachchan persuaded his actress wife, Jaya, to come out of retirement to play his screen wife and his alleged mistress, Rekha, to act in this silly film as his screen mistress. Chopra’s attempt to romanticise adultery via tuneful songs results in a somewhat sleazy film with a traditional cop-out ending. Today, it’s regarded as a flawed cult classic due to its controversial casting and tuneful soundtrack."
73,27. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011),"Translated as ‘You only live once’, this buddy-meets-mid-life-crisis movie sees three friends take a road trip in Spain: Arjun (Roshan) is a workaholic; Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) wants to track down his biological father; and Kabir (Deol) is unsure about his upcoming wedding. ‘Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara’ had a message for middle-class Indians living the new liberal dream with well-paid jobs: it’s okay not to conform or to have a happily-ever-after romance."
74,26. Shaan (1980),"Underrated excellence: Ramesh Sippy’s follow-up to his career-defining ‘Sholay’ (1975) rode in on high expectations and left many viewers underwhelmed. But this story of two conmen (Bachhan and Kapoor) mending their ways and collaborating with a sharpshooter (Shatrughan Sinha) to avenge the death of their cop brother at the hands of the dreaded Shakaal (Kharbanda, in a stunning debut) has aged very well. The cons are very original and the scale of the film extravagantly ambitious."
75,25. Parinda (1989),"The quintessential Bollywood crime film, ‘Parinda’ tells of street-kid brothers Kishen (Shroff) and Karan (Kapoor). When Karan returns after completing his education abroad, he realises his brother has become a gangster working for Anna (Patekar). Boasting of some fine editing by the late Renu Saluja and stellar sound design, the film came to be known for director Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s noir treatment, and all round brilliant acting."
76,24. Jab We Met (2007),"A winning second film from Imtiaz Ali, Jab We Met is the defining romantic comedy of a generation. Genuinely funny and heartwarming, it starts out as the classic story of the lost manchild, Aditya (Shahid Kapoor), encountering the female embodiment of joie de vivre, Geet (Kareena Kapoor), whose effervescent outlook changes his life. But before you can shout ‘manic pixie dream girl!’, their roles are reversed, with Geet’s heartbreak and subsequent descent into depression tended to by the newly go-getting Aditya. In effect, he must bring back to her the joy and zest she bequeathed to him."
77,23. Shree 420 (1955),"Lead actor and director Raj Kapoor modelled his on-screen persona in ‘Shree 420’ and other films after Charlie Chaplin’s Little Tramp. Here he plays Raj, who comes to Bombay to earn a living and falls in love with Vidya (Nargis). However, Raj’s need to make quick money leads him to collaborate with corrupt businessman Dharmanand (Nemo) and his associate, the temptress Maya (Nadira). The film reflected a general state of unrest among unemployed youth and an increasing class divide in the country at the time."
78,22. Om Shanti Om (2007),"A runaway hit on release, ‘Om Shanti Om’ achieved what other similar films before it had tried and largely failed to do – to satirise the idiosyncrasies of the Hindi film industry. ‘Om Shanti Om’ manages this while wearing the garb of a clichéd reincarnation story. Om (Khan) is a junior artist in love with superstar Shanti (Padukone) in the 1970s. Shanti, though, is in love with a wily producer, Mukesh Mehra (Rampal), who has her killed. In the present day, Om is now a superstar out to exact revenge on Mehra, now settled in Hollywood."
79,21. Dil To Pagal Hai (1997),"This musical romance and box-office hit explores the love lives of dancers in a musical troupe. There’s Rahul (Khan), who does not understand how two people can fall in love. Pooja (Dixit) believes in the idea of soulmates and lives by the statement that ‘someone, somewhere is made for you’. Lastly, we have Nisha and her belief that love starts as friendship and two good friends have the potential to love one another right to the end. ‘Dil To Pagal Hai’ is remembered as one of the late Yash Chopra’s best."
80,20. Awaara (1951),"Known as The Show Man, Raj Kapoor’s most famous film is a grand Oedipal melodrama exploring the nature-versus-nurture debate. Will a bandit’s son always end up a criminal? ‘Awara’ explores class division in newly independent India, which excludes the film’s lowly ‘tramp’ hero, Raj (Raj Kapoor), at every point. Its surprise success outside India – especially in the USSR, Africa, China, Greece and the West Indies – was directly responsible for introducing the world to mainstream Hindi cinema."
81,19. Andaz Apna Apna (1994),"Rajkumar Santoshi’s ‘Andaz Apna Apna’ brought together two young, up-and-coming superstars, but the resulting film was a box-office failure. Its cult has grown over the years, spawning fan clubs and websites and ensuring record television ratings time after time. Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan) are wastrels who both want to marry a rich heiress, but they become involved in a feud involving warring twin brothers and a buffoonish villain, Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor)."
82,18. Dil Chahta Hai (2001),"Before the dawn of India’s urban multiplex culture in the mid-2000s, director Farhan Akhtar made his debut with this coming-of-age tale about three Mumbai boys whose language reflected how regular people talked – a refreshing change from other Bollywood films of the time. Akhtar has never been able to better his first film, but with ‘Dil Chahta Hai’ he ushered in a style of storytelling that was new to Indian audiences, where everything from the dialogue and design to the music was subtle and realistic."
83,17. Satya (1998),"‘Satya’ was among a slew of gangster films that hit screens in the late ’90s, and director Ram Gopal Varma has lately come to be associated with the genre. The film tells of Satya (Chakravarty), who is unwittingly sucked into the world of Mumbai crime. What sets ‘Satya’ apart from other gangster films is the realistic portrayal of the criminals’ daily lives and Varma’s unrestrained, gloomy treatment of the subject. It’s considered one of his best films."
84,16. Mr India (1987),"Shekhar ‘Elizabeth’ Kapur’s most famous Bollywood film. Arun (Kapoor) becomes the invisible superhero Mr India, who uses his power to fight the evil Mogambo (Puri) who is intent on taking over the world. Stuffed with as many masala ingredients as possible, this is pure camp nonsense. But it’s told in such a cheeky kitsch way that the viewer surrenders to its sheer energy. ‘Mr India’ is huge fun, especially Mogambo’s catchphrase ‘Mogambo Khush Hua’ (‘Mogambo is happy’) which became a national craze."
85,15. Bombay (1995),"This poignant film covers one of the darkest periods in India’s contemporary history: the 1992 and 1993 Bombay riots. A love story about star-crossed lovers from different faiths who elope to Bombay to start a family, it proved so controversial on its release in 1995 that director Mani Ratnam’s house was bombed by extremists. Nevertheless, its heart, moral centre and cry for peace in India resonated, and ‘Mani Ratnam’ became a critical and commercial success."
86,14. Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959),"In a bizarre case of life imitating the movies, actor-director Guru Dutt died in an apartment in 1964 after allegedly consuming a concoction of sleeping pills and alcohol: his unsuccessful relationship with actor Waheeda Rehman was said to be one of the things that caused him to fall into depression. Six years earlier, Dutt made ‘Kaagaz Ke Phool’, in which he played a director who falls in love with a film actress (played by Rehman). The film ended with Dutt’s character – a dejected filmmaker – dying in his chair at a film studio."
87,13. 3 Idiots (2009),"‘3 Idiots’ charts the japes and scrapes of three students at India’s top engineering university (the film was shot in Bangalore). Along the way, this coming-of-age comedy addresses ‘ragging’ (initiation rituals), the intense pressure to excel in education, student suicide and the tension between the ambitions of students and their parents. ‘3 Idiots’ was a huge hit and confirmed Aamir Khan as the master of balancing good old-fashioned family entertainment with meaningful messages."
88,12. Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (1983),"Loosely inspired by Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 film ‘Blow-Up’, ‘Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro’ (‘Who Pays the Piper’) tells of two Mumbai photographers, Vinod (Shah) and Sudhir (Baswani), who unwittingly take a picture of a corrupt businessman (Kapur) killing a government official. The two discover the dead body and fight to ensure that it doesn’t end up in the hands of a motley group – the killer, his competitor, his two associates and a journalist, all of whom have vested interests in the case."
89,11. RRR (2022),"Believe it or not, this massive action extravaganza and even bigger box-office hit is actually based on two real-life historical figures during the British rule in India. Director SS Rajamouli does give their lives a fully fictionalised and highly bombastic skew, imbuing the men with superhuman powers, fighting against (and, for good measure, with) a myriad of CG animals, as well as the evil Brits, and throws in some musical bangers and some top-notch dance choreography for good measure. The story revolves around tribal leader Komaram Bheem (NT Rama Rao Jr), the protector of a village and its children, and his bromance with A Rama Raju (Ram Charan), a policeman with a hidden identity. They work together to save Malli, the daughter of Loki (not the God of Mischief, but a tribal Indian mum), who is forcefully taken from a forest as a trophy for a colonial wife and her brutal husband, the governor of the district. Cue, well, total mayhem. "
90,10. Amar Akbar Anthony (1977),"The escapist formula honed by director Manmohan Desai (‘Dharam Veer’, Roti’) peaked with this late 1970s film about three brothers – each named in the title – separated at birth. Brimming with clichés and implausible situations, ‘Amar Akbar Anthony’ set the commercial template that many modern Bollywood filmmakers continue to follow. Thirty-five-year-old Amitabh Bachchan, the film’s star, defied his Angry Young Man image – created by a string of sombre action dramas – with his largely comical role."
91,9. Pakeezah (1972),"Lucknow, 1900. Sahibjaan (Kumari) is a ‘dancing girl’ who marries the respectable Salim (R Kumar), despite his dad’s disapproval. Sahibjaan soon considers herself unworthy of her husband and runs away. Will the lovers be reunited and will ‘respectable society’ accept them? Fifteen years in the making (not helped by personal differences between the director and his leading lady, also his wife), this has an evocative soundtrack which is weaved seamlessly into the story, creating perhaps the most magical, lyrical portrayal of idealised erotic romance seen on the Indian screen. The title means ‘Pure’."
92,8. Lagaan (2001),"Set in the nineteenth century, ‘Lagaan’ sees a drought-struck village unite, learn to play cricket and take on their cruel imperial rulers. Although the combination of cricket and colonialism seems like a no-brainer in retrospect, at first nobody would touch this script with a bat. Then star Aamir Khan took the lead role and its critical and box office success ushered in a new era of alternative subject matter and varied storytelling. ‘Lagaan’ is, thus far, the last mainstream Hindi film to be nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars."
93,7. Deewaar (1975),"Evoking ‘Mother India’ with its story of a good son pitched against a bad one and a mother caught between them, ‘Deewaar’ places an anti-hero centrestage. Amitabh Bachchan excels as the simmering Vijay, who turns to criminality to provide for his mum, while brother Ravi (Kapoor) becomes a cop. Inevitably, their paths must cross. ‘Deewaar’ was Bachchan’s first step on the road to mega-stardom and it epitomises his status as the bristling, angry young man railing against all around him."
94,6. Guide (1965),"Director Vijay Anand adapts RK Narayan’s English-language novel into a sprawling drama. ‘Guide’ tells of a man, Raju, who transforms from a tour guide in his youth into a great holy man later in life. The film is considered ahead of its time for showing its protagonists, Raju (Anand) and Rosie (Rehman), having an extra-marital affair, and also for presenting its lead character as an unscrupulous scumbag. Both were deeply unusual in a Hindi film of the time."
95,5. Pyaasa (1957),"Filmmaker Guru Dutt, known for bringing tragic stories to celluloid, plays Vijay, a struggling writer whose two best friends happen to be a streetwalker and a masseuse. Vijay tries unsuccessfully to get his book of poems published and is later believed to have died in a train accident. A cunning publisher prints the book and makes a killing. Maestro composer SD Burman provides a stellar soundtrack, memorable for Sahir Ludhianvi’s poetic verses. With ‘Pyaasa’, Dutt established himself as a filmmaker who could effectively depict the reality of the world around him."
96,4. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995),"Familiar themes of personal choice versus family responsibility, and of forbidden love, are remixed for the 1990s in this epic, era-defining romance. In London, Raj (Khan) is an immature young man, while straight-laced Simran (Kajol) is all set for a marriage arranged by her domineering father. She goes InterRailing in Europe, meets Raj and they fall in love against the backdrop of Swiss mountains. The popularity of the film (the title translates as ‘The brave-hearted will take away the bride’) is reflected in the fact that it has screened daily in Mumbai’s Maratha Mandir cinema for 19 years and counting. This ultimate romance also raised the bar impossibly high for guys chasing girls."
97,3. Mother India (1957),"The first Hindi film to be nominated for Best Foreign-Language Film at the Oscars, this is a heartbreaking story of the complexities of rural farming in newly independent India and the exploitation of farmers by their feudal landlords. It follows the hardships faced by Radha (Nargis), a village mother of three sons who is abandoned by her husband and forced to toil the paddy fields to survive. The film entrenched the idea of the pure, self-sacrificing mother figure as synonymous with the notion of an idealised Indian (Hindu) nation."
98,2. Mughal-e-Azam (1960),"Translated as ‘Emperor of the Mughals’ and set in the late sixteenth century in India’s Mughal period, this is the doomed story of Prince Saleem (Kumar), son of the ruling Emperor Akbar (Kapoor), who falls in love with dancing slave girl Anarkali (Madhubala). This is true epic filmmaking, with magnificent sets, huge battle scenes with hundreds of real elephants, elaborate costumes, an evergreen score and naturalistic acting. It remains a gorgeous evocation of a bygone era, and was one of the rare occasions when a film of the ‘Muslim social’ genre (i.e. interested in Muslim people and culture) became a blockbuster in Hindu-centric India."
99,empty,"This cult masala western sees escaped convicts Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Bachchan) defend a village terrorised by bandits led by the maniacal Gabbar Singh (Khan). ‘Sholay’ has it all – epic dishum-dishum fight scenes, bromance, humour, memorable songs, plot twists, thrilling dance sequences and sparkling performances. The haunting score and Bollywood’s baddest villain are the icing on a rollicking, all-action cake."
